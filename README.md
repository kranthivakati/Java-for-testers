 # JAVA-FOR-TESTERS
This is a complete beginner-friendly guide to learning Java with me.  

Hi, I’m Kranthi, a full-time QA professional passionate about learning Java programming to automate tasks using the Selenium tool.  

 Installation Steps:  
1. Download and install **Eclipse** from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/) by selecting the appropriate version for your operating system.  
2. Install any **LTS** (Long-Term Support) version of Java for stable and extended support.  

Once Java and Eclipse are installed, we’ll dive deep into learning Java!

What is Java?

Java is one of the popular programming languages in the current market. There are many programming languages available, such as Python, C#, C, and Ruby.

Purpose of Java

Java serves two primary purposes:

1.For Developers: Java is used to develop applications.

2.For Testers: Java is used to write test automation scripts for testing applications.

Java can be classified into two ways :

1.core java -> Testers need to learn completely 

2.advance java -> Testers no need to learn only developers need to learn 

**Java is a Object oriented Programming language will discuss this later**

Java is a platform-independent programming language, meaning **"write once, run anywhere."** This means that if a user writes code on a Windows machine and later needs to run it on a different operating system, the same code will work without any modifications. There’s no need to rewrite the code for different operating systems.

consider this an example 

C is not a fully platform-independent programming language. Unlike Java, C programs need to be compiled separately for each operating system.

For example, if a user writes C code on a Windows machine and later needs to run it on another operating system, they must recompile the code on that specific OS. The same code can be used, but it requires a separate compilation process for each platform.
